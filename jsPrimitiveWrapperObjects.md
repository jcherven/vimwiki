# JS Primitives and Wrapper Objects

In js, the following primitive values have wrapper classes that will provide methods and properties that they otherwise don't have.

These wrapper classes don't box your primitive, but are called with the primitive value as an argument directly from the wrapper class.

## `String`
## `Number`
## `Boolean`
## `BigInt`
## `Symbol`
